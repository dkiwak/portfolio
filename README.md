My Testers's Portfolio. 

## About me

I am passionate about software testing and quality assurance. Looking for opportunities in the QA area. My ambition is committing to adding value and achieving goals with the best possible results. I enjoy learning, meeting new people and being part of a highly motivated and results-oriented team.

In the coming time, I intend to expand my qualifications with automated tests.
